<h1 class="pageHeader">About Problematic Subject Term Flags</h1>
  
  <h2>What are subject headings?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/">Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)</a> are standardized words or phrases that describe what an item is about. These are standardized terms that have been agreed upon over many years by the Library of Congress with input from other libraries.
</p>
  <p>From the Library of Congress’ own definition:</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/">LCSH brings consistency to library collections by categorizing topics into logical arrangements, and by controlling synonyms, variant spellings, and homographs. For example, one author may use the phrase soda pop, another may say soft drink; yet another, soda; and a fourth, something else, but they all intend to refer to the same type of beverage. In LCSH, one of those words or phrases is used as the heading, and the others refer to it.  By using only one word or phrase for each topic, librarians can make sure that all of the resources on a topic will be grouped together, thereby allowing users to find them easily.
  </blockquote>
  
  <h2>What are problematic subject headings?</h2>
  <p>Subject terms might be viewed as problematic for a variety of reasons. They may be outdated, hurtful or offensive, inappropriate, or unclear to the point of misunderstanding.</p>
  
  <h2>Why are there problematic subject headings in the library catalog?</h2>
  <p>The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) have been actively maintained since 1898. As language and knowledge changes, these headings must change along with them, but as most academic libraries rely on these terms to ensure that similar items are described consistently, change must occur at the source rather than in individual libraries.</p>
  <p>While there is an established process for adding and revising Library of Congress Subject Headings, it can take time for those changes to be implemented. Some headings may be hurtful, especially when they use outdated terms or offensive language reflective of a different time. Libraries across the country are working to identify these terms and change them.</p>
  <p>The Five Colleges of Ohio Libraries acknowledge the painful impact that these terms can have on our everyday lives. Words matter, language influences ideas, and these ideas create the world around us.  As such, we are committed to improving our systems, including those systems that support research.</p>

  <h2>How are subject headings changed?</h2>
  <p>The Library of Congress has an established <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/cataloging/subject/lcsh-process.html">process</a> for considering additions and revisions to subject headings. This involves preparation and submission of a proposal, typically by members of the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/aba/pcc/saco/index.html">Subject Authority Cooperative (SACO) Program</a>, though they do accept <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcshproposalformnew.pdf">proposals from non-members</a>, followed by a review and decision by the Library of Congress’ Policy, Training, and Cooperative Programs (PTCP) division.</p>

  <h2>Why are some subjects being flagged?</h2>
  <p>The Five Colleges of Ohio Libraries acknowledge that there are terms in the library catalog that are hurtful and offensive. While we retain these terms to support search and discovery by those conducting searches using these terms, we also believe it is important to acknowledge these terms as problematic and advocate for changes. We see flags as an invitation to a dialog with our students, staff, faculty, and community members about identifying and changing problematic language in our profession.
</p>

  <h2>How are terms selected to be flagged?</h2>
  <p>The source of the problematic terms flagged in the catalog comes from an open community-based project called <a href="https://cataloginglab.org/">The Cataloging Lab</a> which invites anyone to submit terms they consider problematic for a variety of reasons. The purpose of this community is to collaborate on the development of more compelling proposals for changes or additions to the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).</p>

  <h2>Can I suggest other terms as problematic?</h2>
  <p>Yes. If you’d like to suggest an alternative term to the Library Community, there are several ways to do so and we’re happy to help you with these as well. The Five Colleges of Ohio Libraries have developed an <a href="https://forms.gle/ER8nJnnowJTBm3io9">online form</a> to collect suggestions. The libraries are happy to offer assistance with submitting suggestions to <a href="https://cataloginglab.org/">The Cataloging Lab</a> and connecting you to information about the process for submitting changes to the Library of Congress.
